Welcome to using DASK on CINECA
=================================

**DASK** is a library for parallelising Python codes.
It is particularly useful for performing data analysis on HPC systems, integrating well with batch schedulers such as GPUs.
When combined with the NVidia Rapids library it can make effective use of GPUs.
In these docs how Dask can be used effectively on CINECA, particularly on Leonardo.


Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
