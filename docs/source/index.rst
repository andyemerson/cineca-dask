Welcome to using DASK on CINECA
===================================

**DASK** (/lu'make/) is a libray for parallelising Python codes.
It is particularly useful for performing data analysis on HPC systems, integrating well with batch schedulers such as GPUs.
When combined with the NVidia Rapids library it can make effective use of GPUs.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
